//Access Modifiers
//we are having access modifiers such that public, private,
//public means it can be accesible from any where, within a same package or without a same package.
//public can be used from same class, same package sub class, same package non-subclass, different package subclass, different package non-subclass.
//in a same file we cant put two classes as a public class.only one class should be considered as public.
//methods should be public.in some case when methods can accessed in its sub-class of other pacakages use it as protected.

//private variables can be used in taht same class irrespective of any packages.
//try to make your instance variable as private.

//if something is not public or private then it can be considered as default constructor.default means it can be simply accesed within same package.

//protected - we can access a protected variable inside a single package, but not with the different package. it can only accesible from different package if its a subclass (like inherit from parent class of that similar package).
//protected can works within same class, same package subclass, same package non-subclass..
