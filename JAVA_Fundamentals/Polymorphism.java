//POLYMORPHISM
//Poly means many and morphism means its behavior. that means a situation when you behaved differently in different situation..

//polymorphism is of two types- compile time polymorphism which is known as early binding and runtime polymorphism is known as late binding.
//if the behavior defined in runtime then its called runtime polymorphism and if the behavior defined in compile time then its known as compile time polymorphism.

//overloading is method of compile time polymorphism,
//Method overriding is known as runtime polymorphism.
