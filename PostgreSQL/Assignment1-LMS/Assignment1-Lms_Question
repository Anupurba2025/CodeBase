• Title

• AuthorID (Foreign Key)

• Authors

• AuthorID (Primary Key)

• Name

• Country

• DateOfBirth

• Members

• MemberID (Primary Key)

• Name

• MembershipDate

• Email







• BorrowingRecords

• RecordID (Primary Key)

• MemberID (Foreign Key)

• BookID (Foreign Key)

• BorrowDate

• ReturnDate



2. Insert Sample Data

Insert at least 5 rows into each table to simulate a library system. For example:

• In the Books table, add books like “Rich dad poor dad,” “2000,” etc.

• In the Authors table, include aurhors.

• Add some Members with realistic names, emails, and membership dates.

• Populate the BorrowingRecords table with borrowing history.

• Delete a member’s record after their membership expires.

6. Complex Query:

• Find members who have borrowed more than 2 books in the last 6 months.



Expected Deliverables

• SQL scripts for creating tables.

• SQL scripts for inserting sample data.

• SQL file with answers to the queries.
