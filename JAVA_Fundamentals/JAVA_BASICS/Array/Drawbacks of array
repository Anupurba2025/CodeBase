1.whenever we are creating an array it will store in a heap memory in a contigious location.
  int arr[]=new int[4];
  whenever we are declaring the size of the array once, we can not change it further.

2. For searching element or assigning a new value to an array every time we should traverse the whole array for each case which is
   very much time consuming.

3. suppose we create an array of type int
    int arr[][]=new int[5][];
    so in this case we can not assign a value of different datatypes.

To resolve this type of issues we are having the concepts of collection.
